- Patients will be able to access their own prescription history through logging into the platform.

## Planning Methodology

Trello has been chosen as the platform for keeping track of this project. 

The Trello board will utilise five lists in which to group tasks:
- Backlog
- In Dev
- For Review
- Dev Done
- Done

***Trello Flow***

1. Ascertain tasks to be completed, write tasks into the **Backlog** list. These tasks will be developed using user stories, which we then break down into discrete tasks that can be completed.
2. Task is picked from the **Backlog**, and put into **In Dev** once begun.
3. Once task is relatively done, transfer task into **For Review**, where task is reviewed by other team member, which may entail further discourse about the task. 
4. If task needs more work, goes back into **In Dev**. If the *development* aspects of the task are done, but the task still requires other additional work such as documentation etc., the task is moved to **Dev Done**, with an accompanying note indicating what else needs to be done. 
5. Tasks are only moved to the final **Done** list when all aspects of a task are complete.
